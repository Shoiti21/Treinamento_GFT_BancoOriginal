All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are expressly reserved to G-Type. </p>
<p>2.3   		You may not use the Font Software for any purpose that is not permitted by this standard use Licence subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You agree not to use the Font Software for any other purpose without a separate Licence from G-Type authorising you to do so. Separate Licences covering web, embedding, corporate or OEM usage are available directly from G-Type. </p>
<p>2.4   		You may install and Use the Font Software on a file server for Use on a single local area network (“LAN”) only when the Use of such Font Software is limited to five (5) Devices including the server.  </p>
<p>2.5   		You may take one (1) copy of the Font Software used for a particular document, or Font Software embedded in an electronic document, to a commercial printer or service bureau for use by the printer or service bureau solely for the purpose of printing such document but only if the printer or  service bureau represents to you that it has purchased or been granted a Licence to use that particular Font Software.</p>
<p>2.6   		Font Software may not be installed or Used on a server that can be accessed via the Internet or other external network system or by Devices that are not covered by this standard Device Licence. In this instance contact G-Type to arrange an appropriate Server Licence.</p>

<p>3. 			MULTI-USER LICENSING </p>
<p>3.1   		If you need to use or store the Font Software on more than five (5) Devices you will need to purchase an appropriate Multi-User/Device Licence. Please contact G-Type or a G-Type authorised distributor if you think that a standard 5 Device Licence is insufficient to meet your needs. An appropriate Multi-User/Device Licence can then be calculated and provided.</p>
<p>3.2   		When determining the number of Devices to be licensed, you must include all Devices that might have access to or might store the Font Software at any point in time. The number must include concurrent and non concurrent use. If the Font Software is stored on a server that is attached to a Local Area Network (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN), every Device and server that has access to the Font Software or stores the Font Software must be included in the Multi-User/Device Licence number to ensure that every Device and server is properly licensed.</p>
<p>3.3   		You should review the number of Devices that have access to the Font Software on a regular basis to ensure that your Multi-User/Device Licence continues to provide a sufficient level of cover. For the purpose of determining the proper number of Devices for which a Multi-User/Device Licence is needed, the following example is supplied for illustration purposes only: if there are one hundred (100) Devices (including servers) connected together as part of a network, with no more than fifteen (15) Devices or servers ever using or storing the Font Software concurrently, but the Font Software will be accessed or used on up to fifty (50) different Devices (including servers) at various points in time, a Multi-User Licence must be obtained for fifty (50) Devices.  </p>

<p>4.1   		Portable Document Format (“PDF”);<br>
You may embed the Font Software into PDF files provided that “subsetting” is employed to minimise as far as possible the number of Font Software characters being embedded. PDF files containing embedded Font Software should be secured as “read only” or configured so that they cannot be edited, altered, enhanced or modified in any way or by any person other than an authorised user and in accordance with this Agreement. You may electronically distribute PDFs containing such embedded Font Software, provided they are not part of a Commercial Product and they are distributed in a secure format that prevents the Font Software from being extracted for any other purpose. Editable embedding or embedding in a Commercial PDF Product requires a separate Licence, contact G-Type for details.</p>
